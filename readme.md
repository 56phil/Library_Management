Sure! Here's a sample README file for your Library Management System (LMS) project:

# Library Management System (LMS)

The Library Management System (LMS) is a console application built using C++. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing books in a library. Users can perform various operations such as adding books, removing books, searching for books by title or author, displaying all books in the library, and more.

## Features

- Add a book to the library
- Remove a book from the library
- Search for a book by title
- Search for a book by author
- Display all books in the library
- User-friendly console interface with a menu system

## Getting Started

To run the Library Management System, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
3. Compile the source code files using the C++ compiler. For example:

   ```shell
   g++ main.cpp book.cpp library.cpp -o lms -lboost_serialization -lncurses -std=c++17
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```shell
   ./lms
   ```

5. The program will display a welcome message and the main menu. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu and perform various operations.

## Requirements

The following software is required to run the Library Management System:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `main.cpp`: The main entry point of the program. It handles user input and menu navigation.
- `book.hpp` and `book.cpp`: The implementation of the `Book` class, which represents a book with attributes like title, author, and ISBN.
- `library.hpp` and `library.cpp`: The implementation of the `Library` class, which manages a collection of `Book` objects and provides operations to add, remove, search, and display books.
- Other necessary header files and libraries (e.g., `iostream`, `string`, `vector`, `unordered_map`, `boost/archive`)
